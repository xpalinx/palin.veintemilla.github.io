						This game was developed by me in one month for a university project for the communication faculty. This was 
						the result of studying in the semester the principles of game narrative vs ludology. In this case I 
						made a chocolate fox that runs from hungry villagers that want to eat him. This was my first approach to Unity.
						I was not rigorous with the design because I actually wanted to have something good at the end. I failed, learned a 
						lot, but failed. We did not finish our prototype.
						I learned to build terrains, to manage collisions, to animate, to control movement with rigid bodies and
						capsule colliders, managed NavMesh basics, UI, etc...

							<h3><a>Pepito</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>This was my first model. I did one animation but didn’t feel enough and I had no time so i tried something else. 
							My teacher told me about Mixamo, so I used it, it did pretty well for the prototype.

							<h3><a>AI</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							For the villagers I used mixamo animations as I tried to do some, but they were not enough.
							The animations came with model, so I used it. The other humanoid I model it myself and retargeted the animations.
							There are two animations for them, one to bite the fox, and the other one to hit other villagers.

						<h3><a></a>Animator for humanoids/a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						This was my result for the animations of the villagers. I used the built-in function from unity Standard Asset for AI's code and studied
						unity’s animator.

						<h3><a>Blooper</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						It was exhausting finding a dog...
						The image says: Here I would put a dog... If I had one!
						On this very first scene, the AI did not work, as the NavMesh needed a terrain. Now I know it wasn't necessary.

						<header>
							<h3><a>First idea</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							As I new a bit of mixamo y tried to apply an animation to this one. It is hard to find dogs with animations... 
							Don't ask me why... Hopefully I found the base frames to make an animation myself.

						<header>
							<h3><a>Got one</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Looking back to my complete failure, I decided to download a dog and animate it. It was cool, I programed big 
							part of the prototype with this one. It just run so I felt there was something missing, and I was running out of time.
							I found a fox with all the animations I needed and more.

						<header>
							<h3><a></a>Changed to fox</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I finally found a fox with all the animations I needed to make the game feel good. It jumped and turned 
							left and right just as I wanted. I added a capsule collider and it worked perfect.

						<header>
							<h3><a></a>BlendTrees</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The Blend Tree management was a challenge that I had to face. Althoug the model and animations for the fox 
							were already created, a substancial amount of research was necessary to real Unity's animator tool.

							<h3><a></a>Basic UI</a></h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							This one-month journey was to be over. One of my partners did these sprites in photoshop and I integrated them to the project.
							from what I learned with the UI I build the Distance and gold system and the time arrived. I missed the health of the player
							which was the most important mechanic for the prototype. At the end the prototype was useless, not playable
							at all but this story led me to my next project.

							<p>
								Game developed by 3 people in company of friends to accomplish perfection.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							This is the project I am currently working on. I help oversee and create game mechanics and game narrative.
							the images below  show  some of the goals I have reached and the incoming tasks I will be
							developing. This game is currently being developed by 3 system engineers, each of us with friends and will to do our best.
							We spent 4 months planning this project and we began to program it in July. This is what we have come up with at the current time.
							We have learnt a lot and figured out how to overcome many obstacles with unity and game mechanics as professional engineers.
						</p>

								<h3><a></a>Prefab used</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>For the manage of the mechanics, i used this prefab. with colliders for Ground Check and climbing</p>
						</article>

							<header>
								<h3><a></a>Animator</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>It was made like this for comfort purposees, as there is a way to do it responsive by code. 
								This time i used like this because of facility, as we needed to complete this project in four months.</p>

								<h3><a></a>Received Animations</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>These were the animations I received from the 3D artist to make the third person movement. 
								They were low fps so i got to speed them up in unity.</p>

							<header>
								<h3><a>Mouvement mechanics</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>The result of this mechanics, including the animations were pretty good.
								I tried to do something like GenshinImpact movement with some changes for our own.
								I used Cinemachine for the camera and used it as an input for the direction vector.

							<header>
								<h3><a></a>Climbing and respawning</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>This two mechanics were tricky at the beginning. The character turns towards the climbing object, and climbs up and down
								with one single animation provided. When he reaches the top of the object, he does the ledge animation.
							</p>

							<header>
								<h3><a></a>AI</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>The prefab is instantiated after the interaction shown. Using NavMesh, he follows
								the path and finally he leaves the room through the door. The animations are to be integrated soon.

							<header>
								<h3><a>Incoming work</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								These are the animations that are going to be implemented for the enemy. 
								I have one month to get the animations working, the Paths fully configured and the attacking mechanics.
								After that, the games narrative is ready to begin.
